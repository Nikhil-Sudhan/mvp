# Drone Configuration Panel Testing Guide

## Issue Resolution Summary

The drone configuration panel was not visible in the application due to the sidebar manager using fallback HTML instead of loading the actual drone configuration component. This has been fixed by:

1. **Updated the fallback HTML** in `sidebarManager.js` to include the complete drone configuration panel content
2. **Added emergency CSS** to ensure the panel is visible with proper styling
3. **Added direct CSS link** in the main `index.html` file
4. **Added debugging** to track panel loading and visibility

## How to Test the Drone Configuration Panel

### Method 1: Main Application
1. Open the Avionixis application (should be running on `http://localhost:3000`)
2. Click on the **cogs icon** (⚙️) in the left sidebar to open the Drone Configuration panel
3. The panel should expand and show:
   - "Add Drone" button with dropdown
   - Two drone cards (Phantom X2 and Hovermax) with status indicators
   - Configuration sections for Connection Settings, Flight Parameters, and Safety Settings
   - Action buttons (Save, Load, Reset)

### Method 2: Standalone Test
1. Open `test-drone-config.html` in your browser
2. This shows the drone configuration panel in isolation
3. Test the "Add Drone" dropdown functionality

## Expected Features

### Drone Fleet Section
- **Phantom X2 Card**: Shows battery level (78%), signal strength, range (15km), payload (2.5kg)
- **Hovermax Card**: Similar metrics with active status indicators
- **Add Drone Button**: Dropdown with Hovermax and Phantom X2 options

### Configuration Sections
- **Connection Settings**: Connection type, port/address, baud rate
- **Flight Parameters**: Max altitude, speed, return home altitude, auto land battery
- **Safety Settings**: Geofence, obstacle avoidance, auto return home, emergency motor cutoff

### Interactive Elements
- **Add Drone Dropdown**: Click to show/hide drone options
- **Configuration Inputs**: All form fields should be functional
- **Action Buttons**: Save, Load, and Reset configuration

## Troubleshooting

If the panel is still not visible:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify CSS Loading**: Check if `droneConfiguration.css` is loaded
3. **Check Sidebar State**: Ensure the left sidebar is expanded
4. **Refresh Page**: Sometimes a page refresh is needed after changes

## Debug Information

The application now includes console logging to help debug issues:
- Panel loading status
- Element visibility checks
- Sidebar expansion state
- CSS loading confirmation

## Files Modified

- `renderer/components/common/sidebarManager.js` - Updated fallback HTML and added debugging
- `renderer/index.html` - Added direct CSS link
- `test-drone-config.html` - Created standalone test file

The drone configuration panel should now be fully functional and visible in the Avionixis application!
