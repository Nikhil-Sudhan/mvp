# Weather Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
The Sky Loom application now includes real-time weather data integration that automatically detects your location and displays current weather conditions in both the dashboard and status bar.

## Features
- **Automatic Location Detection**: Uses browser geolocation to get your current position
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches current temperature, conditions, wind speed, and humidity
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates flight risk based on weather conditions
- **Dashboard Integration**: Updates weather widget with current conditions
- **Status Bar Updates**: Shows temperature in the bottom status bar
- **Fallback Support**: Uses mock data if location access is denied or API is unavailable
- **No API Key Required**: Uses free Open-Meteo API

## Setup Instructions

### ✅ **No Setup Required!**
The weather service now uses **Open-Meteo**, which is completely free and doesn't require any API key or registration. The system will work immediately without any configuration.

### 3. Location Permissions
- The app will request location access when first loaded
- If denied, it will use a default location (Pune, India)
- You can manually update location using the weather service API

## How It Works

### Location Detection
- Uses `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` to get user coordinates
- Falls back to default location if geolocation is not supported or denied
- Location is cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls

### Weather Data
- Fetches data from **Open-Meteo API** every 10 minutes
- Includes temperature, conditions, wind speed, and humidity
- Calculates flight risk level based on weather conditions
- Uses **Nominatim** for reverse geocoding to get location names

### Risk Assessment
The system calculates risk levels based on:
- **Temperature**: Ideal range 15-25°C
- **Wind Speed**: Ideal < 10 m/s
- **Humidity**: Ideal range 30-70%

Risk levels: Low, Medium, High

### Updates
- Dashboard weather widget updates automatically
- Status bar temperature updates in real-time
- Weather icons change based on conditions
- Location selector shows current location

## API Usage
The weather service provides these methods:

```javascript
// Get current weather data
const weather = window.weatherService.getCurrentWeather();

// Update location manually
await window.weatherService.updateLocation(lat, lon);

// Subscribe to weather updates
window.weatherService.onWeatherUpdate((weatherData) => {
    console.log('Weather updated:', weatherData);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Weather Data
- Verify internet connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure location permissions are granted
- Check if Open-Meteo API is accessible

### Location Not Working
- Check browser geolocation settings
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if HTTPS is required (some browsers require secure context)

### API Limits
- **Open-Meteo API**: Completely free, no rate limits
- **Nominatim API**: Free with reasonable usage limits
- Weather updates every 10 minutes = 144 calls/day
- Well within free tier limits

## Security Notes
- No API keys required - completely secure
- Location data is only used for weather requests and not stored
- All APIs used are free and open-source
